Absolutey terrible script to make downloading pre-determined (by me) L4D2 maps onto the Steam Deck easier. 

How to use:

- Right click (Hold left shoulder trigger while tapping the link on Steam Deck) [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/M0nheim/l4d2-deck-mods-downloader/main/downloader.desktop) link and click "Save Link as...". Make sure "Desktop" is selected and remove the ".download" file extension (It should simply say downloader.desktop). Hit "Save".
- Find the new Icon on your Desktop called "L4D2 Map Downloader" and open it.
- Let it do its thing and hope nothing breaks.
- Enjoy!
